# Stat547 Assignment 1: Data wrangling wrap up

This is my submission for assignment 1 of the 2018 iteration of the Stat547 course at UBC. This course picks up where the Stat545 course left of.

In the last assignment in Stat545 we dealt with categorical variables using the `forcats` package and explored options for improving plots. In this assignment we will using `purr` to more efficiently wrangle data.

Please refer to [purrr-exercise.md](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw06-shreeramsenthi/blob/master/purrr-exercise.md) for the exercise along with relevant code and figures.
